# pear

![travis status](https://travis-ci.org/ScalaIO/pear.svg?branch=master)

ScalaIO's conference management tool

The name acts as a (poor) multi-layered wordplay: "pear" is really close to "peer" as in "peer review" which is central to any conference organisation. Also, there is a variety of pears named "Conf√©rence", which makes perfect sense :)
